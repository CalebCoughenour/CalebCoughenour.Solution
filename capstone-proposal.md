Name of Student: Caleb Coughenour

Name of Project: Caleb's Portfolio

Project's Purpose or Goal: This will serve as a website that I can use to display my resume, an about me and show off projects that I have made. This will be very useful for applying to jobs.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
- Fully styled MVC pages
- Display 3 projects(picture, description, links)
- About me page with picture and description

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
- C#
- HTML
- CSS

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
- Deploy the page live on the web
- Add animations for extra flare
- Add react to mvc page(need to research how to do this, might not be possible to add after i've started)

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
- ASP.NET Core
- REPL

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

- Nothing notable, this is a very basic idea. I hope to use this as a project I can show off to interviewers, and since it's so simple I will try to add more stretch goals.
